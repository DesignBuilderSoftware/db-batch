class Watcher(Thread):

    A base thread to monitor specified paths.

    Given paths are being checked for changes,

    have been produced.

    Once the calculation finishes (either successfully
    or once timeout expires), watcher needs to be closed
    externally - using 'stop' method.

    All the files which were produced during the run will
    be passed into queue for further processing (copying to
    specified location using 'Collector' thread).

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_name : str
        A name of the monitored model.
    paths : list of (str, path like)
        A list of paths which are being checked for changes.

class EplusWatcher(Watcher):
    """
    A watcher to monitor EnergyPlus simulation.

    Watcher monitors standard 'EnergyPlus' and jobserver
    directory to find out if the simulation runs using
    'Simulation Manager' or 'Standard' simulation.

    Once the '.err' file is produced, watcher reads
    the file to get the status of the simulation run (this can
    be either 'Failed' or 'Successful').

    Based on the status, specific set of files will be
    passed into queue for further processing (copying to

        A path to DesignBuilder directory storing Simulation
        Manager jobs.
